ARC1:

In directory '/exports/nas/exports/cse/geos/scratch/gc/sst-cci/avhrr/l1b', call

/exports/work/geos_gc_sst_cci/avhrr/scripts/start_LOC.bash $filename,

where $filename has to point to a file somewhere below the current directory.

The output file is put into /exports/work/scratch/sst-cci/LOC; the file name is the name of the source file, plus the
string '.LOC' just before the file extension. The log files are in /exports/work/scratch/sst-cci/LOC/stdout, named like
the source file, but prefixed with 'LOC_' and suffixed by the processor id.

ARC2:

Just like ARC1; the only difference is that the call is 

/exports/work/geos_gc_sst_cci/avhrr/scripts/start_ARC2.bash $filename /exports/work/geos_gc_sst_cci/avhrr/matchups.txt,

where matchups.txt is the list of matchups.

ARC3:

Calling ARC3 is more complicated.
An easy solution is to copy the executable and the files needed for execution to a dedicated directory. The files needed
are:

- the executable (MMD_SCREEN_Linux)
- the configuration file (MDB.INP)
- the dat-directory
- test_nwp.nc

and are located at /exports/nas/exports/cse/geos/scratch/gc/sst-cci/tmp/arc3_example.
The reason why these files should be copied is that possibly they need to be re-configured; for example, the file
CCI_MMD_AATSR_img.INF contains information about dimension names.

From the directory the files have been copied to, the call is then

./MMD_SCREEN_Linux MDB.INP $source $nwp $target,

where $source is the source MMD file, $nwp the NWP file to be used, and $target the output file. The logfile is called
MDB.log.
