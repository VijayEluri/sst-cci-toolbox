More questions to Nick / Chris:

1. When aggregating from 0.1 (0.05) deg cells to 5 deg cells, *all regions*:
   We currently weight each 0.1 (0.05) deg contribution according to its ocean coverage in that 0.1 (0.05) cell.
   However, the spec doesn't say so, but I thought, it is just consequent since for aggregating from 5 deg to 90 deg
   cells and from aggregating all the 90 deg cells to a single value we do it as well.
   Please confirm that this is wanted for both, SST anomaly and uncertainties.
2. From the spec:
   "If required temporal resolution is seasonal or annual (or some other combination of months),
   then aggregate first to monthly averages and monthly uncertainties, before averaging monthly
   averages and propagating monthly uncertainties to coarser temporal resolution.":
   Shall we
   (a) average the means first, thus sigma in 1.1 and 1.2 is a monthly uncertainty mean and n is the number of months, or
   (b) compute a total uncertainty mean from all monthly sums (not means), thus sigma in 1.1 and 1.2 is a daily
       uncertainty and n is the total number of days?
   If it is (a), should we weight according to the total number of contributions in each month?
3. The monthly, seasonal (3 months), annual (12 months) resolutions are currently implemented as time steps
   based on the Gregorian calendar, starting from the user-given start date.
   Do we have to consider other time steps as well, e.g. 10-day steps, meteorological season?
   If so, how important is that?
