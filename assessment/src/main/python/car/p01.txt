The SST CCI products and the comparison data sets are presented on a range of different
grids and also, in those cases where the data are presented as anomalies, relative to
different climatological averages. In order to make a direct comparison, the data were
first converted into anomalies relative to the MyOcean OSTIA reanalysis climatology for
the period 1985-2007. The climatology was regridded from 0.05 degree latitude by 0.05
degree longitude daily to have the same resolution as the data set being processed.
Secondly a common mask was applied to the data. Again this was based on the MyOcean
OSTIA reanalysis climatology.
