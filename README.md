ESA SST_cci Toolbox 
===================

Toolbox overview
----------------

The Toolbox services will be implemented basically a set of programs written in the Java
programming language. A number of the required functions are already implemented in
ESA BEAM libraries, which are used for the development of the tools. Users will be able 
to invoke the tools either via a posix
shell compatible command-line interface and/or plugged into the 
[BEAM](http://www.brockmann-consult.de/cms/web/beam/)/VISAT graphical
user interface. For all tools a technical description and user guide will be provided.

The Toolbox is composed of numerous services and features on top of the *Multi-sensor Match-up 
System (MMS)* and the full EO / reference data collections. It addresses the different 
needs of the EO Science and Climate teams during the various project tasks.

For Task 2 it provides features for:

* Generation of datasets used for SST algorithm development and improvement, alidation and round-robin inter-comparison,
* Algorithm inter-comparison and selection.

For Task 3 it provides features for:

* Verification of the correct implementation of the prototype system against the algorithms,
* Generation of the CRDP and the verification of the data products contained herein.

For Task 4 it provides features for:

* ECV product inter-comparison and validation,
* Analysis of multi-annual trends in ECV products.

We propose to implement the majority of the Toolbox features using the ESA BEAM Development 
Platform. Many of the required functions and features are already available as executable 
tools in BEAM. 
Other features can be implemented straight forward using the various BEAM application 
programming interfaces (APIs). The desktop application provides advanced imaging,
processing and analysis out-of-the-box, permitting effective assessment of data products 
by the EO Science Team and Climate Research Group.
